# TP4
Multitasking and Real Time OS Design Course

##  Compilation

### 1) Create a folder called "build" and access it

```bash
mkdir build
cd build
```

### 2) To compile the project, run the following commands:

```bash
cmake ..
make
```

## Execution

After compiling with the commands above, executables will be generated in the "build" folder. Each executable represents a question of the TP. The commands to run each of them are:

- Question A
```bash
./MainA 100000000 2
```
It is worth noting that in Question A, it is necessary to declare the nLoops variable and the number of tasks.
